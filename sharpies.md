Sharpies List
=============

(A place for me to jot notes of people who care about their configs. I plan on
disecting every line at some point, maybe even set up a feed of their commits
so I can get the state of the art.)

- [rkingy-dots-conf](https://github.com/ouicode/rkingy-dots-conf) - Our
  current run at it.

- [Frank Terbeck](https://dev.0x50.de/projects/ftzsh) - Super detailed config.
  Only downside is the heavy focus on working for many versions of zsh.

- ["scp1"](https://github.com/trapd00r/configs) - More.

- [Spaceghost](https://github.com/Spaceghost/config) - More ideas - especially
  how it interactively prompts for github info on the first run. Probably good
  pattern in general. (zsh itself has an interactive "first time" setup.)

- [epitron](https://github.com/epitron/scripts) - A lot of little bits.

- [dotfiles.org](http://dotfiles.org/) - Sprawling collection of config files.

- [Mon Ouie](https://github.com/Mon-Ouie/dotfiles) - The Rimbaud of Ruby, and
  also his dotfiles taught be about the zsh-syntax-highlighting repo.

- [dukeleto](http://github.com/leto/Util) - Cool hacker, but I haven't checked
  his sharpness levels yet.

- [Mikachu](http://mika.l3ib.org/code/dot-zshrc) - Pretty cool guy on #zsh.

Vim in particular:
------------------

- [spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim/blob/master/.vimrc) - Claims to be the Ultimate Vimrc, has some good ideas.

- [carlosedp/vimfiles](https://github.com/carlosedp/vimfiles) - JS/Node/Ruby/etc vim files

Zsh in particular:
------------------

- [Zsh Wiki](http://zshwiki.org/home/)
